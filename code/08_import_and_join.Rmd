#set-up dataset
```{r}
source(here::here("code", "healthcare.R"))
```

# A note about `here()`
The `here` package is an easy, and reproducible way to set the path of your file.  
For example, your code lives in the /code directory, so to point to it, you simply call the here function, and then put your destination(s) in quotes

`here::here("my", "nested", "file", "lives", "in", "this", "directory", "file.Rmd)`  
  
# Import
Use this code chunk to import the dataset  
*use `read_csv()`, and don't forget to assign it to an object
