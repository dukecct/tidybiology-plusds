# Introduction to Data Science in Health Care (Sessions 1 and 2)

The ability to make data-driven decisions is redefining the future of
patient care. This two-part series provides an introduction to the
emerging field of health data science using the R software language,
including data analysis and visualization, with a particular focus on
its utility for insight in healthcare. No prior knowledge of data
science or computer programming is assumed; laptops are required.
Attendees will be provided with healthcare dataset examples, and
introduced to R packages and code used to examine data. Particular
attention will be paid to code interpretation and data provenance
methods by learning to generate reproducible data output files. Although
specific datasets will be used for analysis in class, this workshop will
provide broadly applicable tools to reproducibly analyze and visualize
data across the healthcare continuum. This series has two parts;
participants are encouraged to register for both sessions (April 8 and
9, 2020).

## Heart Disease Public Health Dataset

<https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/version/2>

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland,
Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes,
including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer
to using a subset of 14 attributes:  
1\. age: age in years  
2\. sex: (1 = male; 0 = female)  
3\. cp: chest pain type, (4 values)  
4\. trestbps: resting blood pressure, resting blood pressure (in mm Hg
on admission to the hospital)  
5\. chol: serum cholestorol in mg/dl  
6\. fbs: fasting blood sugar, fasting blood sugar \> 120 mg/dl (1 =
true; 0 = false)  
7\. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)  
8\. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved  
9\. exang: exercise induced angina, (1 = yes; 0 = no)  
10\. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
11\. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
12\. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flouroscopy  
13\. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect  
14\. target: the presence of heart disease in the patient (0 = no
disease; 1 = disease)
